# Contributing to JupyterLab

## General Guidelines

For general documentation about contributing to Jupyter projects, see the
[Project Jupyter Contributor Documentation](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributor/content-contributor.html) and [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/jupyter/governance/blob/master/conduct/code_of_conduct.md).

All source code is written in
[TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/Handbook). See the [Style
Guide](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/wiki/TypeScript-Style-Guide).

All source code is formatted using [prettier](https://prettier.io).
When code is modified and committed, all staged files will be automatically
formatted using pre-commit git hooks (with help from the
[lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) and
[husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) libraries). The benefit of using a
code formatter like prettier is that it removes the topic of code style from the conversation
when reviewing pull requests, thereby speeding up the review process.

You may also use the prettier npm script (e.g. `npm run prettier` or `yarn prettier` or `jlpm prettier`) to format the entire code base. We recommend
installing a prettier
extension for your code editor and configuring it to format your code with
a keyboard shortcut or automatically on save.

## Setting Up a Development Environment

### Creating the environment using conda

Building JupyterLab Commenting and Annotation from its GitHub source code requires Node.js and JupyterLab.

If you use `conda`, you can get it with:

```bash
conda create -n jupyterlab-commenting -c conda-forge --override-channels nodejs jupyterlab

# and activate your new environment
conda activate jupyterlab-commenting

```

## Build and install the extension for development

Run the following commands to install the initial project dependencies and install it in the JupyterLab environment.

```bash

jlpm install
jupyter labextension install . --no-build

```

After the install completes, open a second terminal. Run these commands to activate the `jupyterlab-commenting`
environment and to start a JupyterLab instance in watch mode so that it will keep up with our changes as we make them.


```bash

conda activate jupyterlab-ext
jupyter lab --watch

```

### Build and Run the Tests

```bash
jlpm run build:test
jlpm test
```

## [Writing Documentation](#writing-documenation)

Documentation is written in Markdown and reStructuredText. In particular, the documentation on our Read the Docs page is written in reStructuredText. To ensure that the Read the Docs page builds, you'll need to install the documentation dependencies with `conda`. These dependencies are located in `docs/environment.yml`. You can install the dependencies for building the documentation by creating a new conda environment:

```bash
conda env create -f docs/environment.yml
```

Alternatively, you can install the documentation dependencies in an existing environment using the following command:

```bash
conda env update -n <ENVIRONMENT> -f docs/environment.yml
```

The Developer Documentation includes a [guide](http://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/documentation.html) to writing documentation including writing style, naming conventions, keyboard shortcuts, and screenshots.

To test the docs run:

```
py.test --check-links -k .md . || py.test --check-links -k .md --lf .
```

The Read the Docs pages can be built using `make`:

```bash
cd docs
make html
```

Or with `jlpm`:

```
jlpm run docs
```
