    "## Commenting on text files\n",
    "\n",
    "To comment on a text file, you can either select exactly what you want to comment on, right click, and select the option `Create New Comment`, then go about creating the thread. Or you can just right click the line you want to comment on, and the entire line will be marked when `Create New Comment` is selected.\n",

    "## Where do comments save?\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently comments are saved in a file that is generated in the root directory of your Jupyterlab enviroment in a file called **comments.json**. This file saves all your comments and indicators. The file can be shared and others can copy it to their file tree, or if they already have a comments.json file, they can copy the contents of the new one into their existing file.\n"
