## Overview

The commenting panel is located on the right side panel on Jupyter's main area.

When opened for the first time it will ask for you github username to know who is commenting. This uses the [public GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/) to get your name and profile image.

Once logged in, you are able to do a variety of things.

## Where do comments save?

Currently comments are saved in a file that is generated in the root directory of your Jupyterlab enviroment in a file called **comments.json**. This file saves all your comments and indicators. The file can be shared and others can copy it to their file tree, or if they already have a comments.json file, they can copy the contents of the new one into their existing file.
